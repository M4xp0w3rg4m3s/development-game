## 📜 Game Overview

In the heart of a forgotten cave lies a slumbering adventurer, cursed to awaken once every century when an ancient evil rises. Each time, he embarks on a perilous journey to hunt and destroy the mythical Crystal Golem that threatens the world. His path winds through dense forests, treacherous mountains, roaring rivers, and frozen wastelands. As days pass, the burden of his quest deepens—for victory may come at a cost beyond comprehension.
